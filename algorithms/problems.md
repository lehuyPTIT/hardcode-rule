# Week 1
Host: linxgnu

**Bài 1:** tính N^M % K, trong đó M N K nguyên dương, giới hạn là 10^9 nhé

**Bài 2:** cho N cái cân, trọng lượng từ 1 tới N luôn. Người ta cân chơi chơi như sau: có cái cân thằng bằng (2 bên), mỗi lần người ta cho 1 quả cân nào đó từ N quả cân đó lên 1 trong 2 đĩa cân bất kì rồi ghi lại xem bên nào nặng hơn. Nếu bên trái nặng hơn ghi 0, bên phải nặng hơn ghi 1. Sau đó người ta quên mất thứ tự đặt quả cân, chỉ còn lại N - 1 số 0 và 1 như trên. Câu chuyện vui là thử tìm một thứ tự đặt cân sao cho ra được cái lời giải 0 1 trên

**Bài 3:** https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/

**Bài 4:** toán hình học cơ bản, gơi ý là bài này luôn có solution, không yêu cầu submit, chỉ yêu cầu nghĩ ra lời giải, và hãy thử giải quyết bài toán với 4 vector thôi: http://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?num=1130

**Bài 5:** bài này gợi ý là duyệt trâu bò cũng ăn, nhưng có cách giải 2^(N/2) * log: http://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1005

**Bài 6:** (bài này hồi mình phỏng vấn garena bị hỏi) để detect workload của hệ thống, Garena muốn biết tại thời điểm nào có nhiều request nhất. Có N request, request bắt đầu lúc Ai và kết thúc lúc Bi [Ai ; Bi]. Tính thời điểm mà server phải xử lý nhiều request cùng lúc nhất. N <= 10000

**Bài 7:** cho một ma trận các bóng đèn M dòng, N cột, M < 10, N < 1000. Các bóng đèn ở hai trạng thái là bật / tắt. Một thao tác bật công tắc tại ô (i,j) là bật/tắt 4 ô xung quanh và chính nó. Tìm cách để tắt hết đống bóng đèn trên.

**Bài 8:** https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/
